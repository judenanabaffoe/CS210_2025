CS210 - C++ Introduction
Corner Grocer Program - Jude Mensah Nana Baffoe

Scenario
You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior developer, and you exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead Banking. Since your team is impressed with your work, they have given you another, more complex assignment. Your task is to build an item tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. 

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Developed a C++ solution for The Corner Grocer to analyze daily sales records. The program processes text-based item data from input files, calculates purchase frequencies, and generates formatted reports including histogram visualizations and backup data files.   
2) What did you do particularly well?

Code organization: Implemented modular, logically structured functions
Documentation: Comprehensive step-by-step explanations of implementation logic
Error handling: Robust file I/O operations with validation checks   

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Improvement	Impact
Graphical UI with store branding	Enhanced user engagement
Pricing integration + total calculation	Commercial functionality
Data encryption for backup files	Improved security
   
4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Histogram generation: Solved through iterative testing of output formatting
File I/O synchronization: Resolved by implementing atomic write operations
Debugging resources: Leveraged GDB for stack tracing and Valgrind for memory validation   

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
Data parsing algorithms
Map-based frequency counting
File stream management
Modular code architecture  

6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Version control: Git for incremental backups
Clean code principles:
Descriptive variable naming
Function-based modularization
Strategic code commenting
Adaptability: Designed with extensible interfaces for future e-commerce integration
